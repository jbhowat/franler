## Dev Log - Day 1

0700 - Project begins. I started by setting up webpack, git, this readme, and an initial file structure. Went to logo.com to get a free basic set of logos for the project. I'm pretty pleased with the outcome. Ran into some issues with configuring webpack for .jsx files and making it all work but figured it out.

0930 - Wrote and submitted project brief. Included a screenshot of the initial brief in the readme file for posterity.  

1115 - I've gotten everything setup for the server side now (node/express) and the client side (react) as far as the absolute minimum basics. The front and back end are talking to each other. Did a little work on the readme file just to try to make this documentation as nice as possible as I go. Lunch / errand break. 

1458 - Spun up mongoDB server on Atlas Cloud service. Installed mongoose and linked backend to the database. Added dummy data to the database using MongoDB Compass. Was able to retrieve that data and pass it all the way to the front end. The R in CRUD now works at its most basic level. C, U, and D are next.
